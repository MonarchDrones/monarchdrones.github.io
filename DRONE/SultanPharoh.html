        <p class="description-one">Both Sultan and Pharoh are derived from the Desert King prototype, leveragig the same infrared camera, AI technology, and open source design philosophy.  However, though Sultan and Pharoh wil share a chasis, the overall design will differ from Desert King. Sultan and Pharoh both require a modular bay for their intended missions and goals, Sultan wil be a military explosive ordinance dropping drone, similar to the Baba Yaga UAV seen most commonly in Ukraine. Whereas the midular bay on Phjaroh will be used to deliver medical aid to disaster survivors or others in need in hard to reach places. Both Sultan and Pharoh will be maed out of carbon fiber, on a hexacoptor base, with each rotor supporting 2 or 3 propellers, the number is undecided. 2 propellers per rotor would grant the drone longer range at the cost of handling and thrust.</p>

        <p class="title-one">Pharoh</p>
        <p class="description-one">Pharoh's iterations from Desert King are not monumental. The chassis gets an overall size increase to deal with the added wight from the medical bay and any additional avionics. Redudnat safty features wil be incorperated. The goal of Pharoh is to serve as a Search and Rescue accesory, as well as a First Aid accesory, able to identify people in need of medical attention and deliver much needed suplies in a timley maner. Pharoh can also be reporgrammed to assist in Wildfire prevention, adding another dimesion to its capabilities.
 
        <p class="title-one">Sultan</p>
        <p class="description-one">Sultan is the centerpiece of the Desert King improvement. Sultan is a ground attack drone, designed for anti-infantry and anti-armor roles. Most coptor UAVs in active warzones are one-time use "suicide" drones. Sultan aims to be reusbale and survivable. Carrying over the IR and AI features of Desert King, Sultan adds a moduilar payload bay. Said payload bay will be designed to accomidate a lare variety of muntion. One concepted weapon bay consists of a multiple launch 40x46 mm low velocity grenade system, to be used agaisnt unarmored infanrty. Another conepted bay consistys of a a 105 or 155 mm artilery high exploive submunition for anti-armor roles agaisnt entrneched personell. Sultan will have a dedciated onboard Continually Computed Impact Point caclulation to assist operators in delivery of ordinance. Sultan will have an onboard set of active and passive defences. The chassis will be annodized with aluminum to resist potential laser interceptions, and the radio communications between the operatore and the drone will be encoded ensuirng stable connection. Most damage Sultan sustains in the field can be fixed by 3D printer, which makes a full kenetic or explosive strike againt the drone the only feasable method of eliminating it. Overall Sultan will compete with drones like the Ukranian Baba Yaga, while having increased capibilities and reduced costs compard to its counterparts.
