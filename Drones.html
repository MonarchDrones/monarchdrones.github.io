        <p class="description-one"> Modern drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), have become a significant technological advancement in the 21st century, influencing various sectors including military, commercial, and recreational fields. Initially developed for military purposes, drones have evolved rapidly since their inception, offering capabilities such as surveillance, reconnaissance, and targeted strikes without risking human lives.

        In the commercial sector, drones have found applications in areas like agriculture, where they monitor crops and optimize farming practices; in logistics, where companies like Amazon explore their use for delivering packages; and in filmmaking and photography, providing unprecedented aerial shots. The technology has also advanced to include sophisticated features such as autonomous flight, obstacle avoidance, and high-resolution imaging.

        <a><image src="IMAGES/Drone.jpg" class="Stop1"></image>
        <p class="description-one">Drones are at the heart of Monarch's mission. Most drones today are "coptors" are whihc are multirotor UAVs. The most common "coptors" are quadcoptors, which consist of four rotors on an X frame. As a rule of thumb, the more rotors the larger the drone and the more it can lift. Hexacoptors have 6 rotors, and Octacoptors have 8, both are commonly used in industiral and aggricultural applications, as the additional rotors addmore stability and redundancy to the UAV.
