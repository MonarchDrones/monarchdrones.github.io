        <p class="title-one">Design</p>
        <p class="description-one">The "Desert King" drone is a prototype technology demonstrator, and a pre-cursor to the "Sultan" and "Pharoh" drones. Desert King's key functionality demonstrates the use of thermal cameras on a drone, AI suported hardware and software for human detection, and the use of open source 3D printing manufacuring and fabrication techniques.</p>
        
        <p class="title-one">Thermal Cameras</p>
        <p class="description-one">Thermal imagry is the centerpon of the Desert King project. While most quadcoptors use standard visual light cameras, the Sultand and Pharoh concept drones will need to leverage cameras able to locate and track humans in all conditions and enviorments. Smaller quadcoptors often lack the size to fit fully fledged and articulatable cameras, however, considering that Desert King is a prototype, sacraficing flight time and preformance is the likely solution. Both Sultan and Pharoh will overcome this issue by levraging a larger chassis, more rotors, more powerful motorts, and more propellers. Potential canidates for the infrared camera are Emberion and Automatuion Technology, though mounting and properly integrating the camera would be a challenge.

        <p class="title-one">AI</p>
        <p class="description-one">Desert King's AI toolset makes the drone stand out from the rest. While all drone have onboard computers to corntol their flight and any other accesoriees. Desert King uses AI to suppliemnt and enhace its accesories and use cases. ConcurrentEDA offers an AIO computer that uses an AMD Ryzen 2700x CPU and a AMD Versal AI chip. ConcurrentEDA's configuration was able to support 4 cameras running on a simolutanious display, able to detect, track, and distingiush humans from other objects, all while running at 50 watts. The low powerdraw and slim formfactor from ConcurrentEDA's AIO AI PC would enable the Desert King to fully accomplish its goals, all while in a relativly small chassis, which would allow Desert King to ave increased speed and range.</p>

        <p class="title-one">3D Printing</p>
        <p class="description-one">Desert King also aims to be a rapidly iteratable peototype, allowing for quick repairs, modifications, and component changes. On way to go about this is the use of 3D printers. Becasue Desert King aims to be made mostly out of PETG, reducing weight though sacrificing some durability. By using PETG, critical flight failures can be rapidly and easily remedied, granting the operator of Desert King more flexability pertaining ot testing. Additionally if modificatios are needed, Desert King can have components swapped out for different mateirals like PLA, TPU, Resin, and Carbon Fiber. However, the more advanced the material, the more costluy the 3D printer will be, so while the final prototype of Desert King aims to be carbon fiber, that would come at a hefty cost in the small thousands. Ideal starting printer primatily consist of Ender 3, Prusa Mini, and Prusa Mk4.</p>

        <p class="title-one">Summary</p>
        <p class="description-one">By using 3D printing and CAD techniques, coupled with an AI centric onboard computing system and a central articulatable infrared camera, Desert King would be a noteworthy tehcnology demonstrator which would pave the way for Sultan and Pharoh drones, as well as future concept drones.</p>
